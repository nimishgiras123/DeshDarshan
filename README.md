## Problem Statement

- In today's rapidly evolving travel landscape, tourists often face challenges in accessing accurate and insightful information about historical monuments and sites.

- Tourism often presents challenges for travelers, including language barriers, lack of historical context, and the need for personal guides in crowded or remote areas. Visitors are left to rely on guidebooks and fragmented information sources to explore historical sites and cultural landmarks, resulting in subpar, non-immersive experiences.

- Additionally, the travel guides may not always provide accurate information and some may even engage in fraudulent practices.
